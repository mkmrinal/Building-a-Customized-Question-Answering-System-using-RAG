# Building-a-Customized-Question-Answering-System-using-RAG
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to develop a
customized question-answering system that retrieves and processes city-related information
from various sources. The system integrates semantic search, external data retrieval, and
large language model (LLM)-based response generation to provide fact-based, contextually
relevant answers to user queries
